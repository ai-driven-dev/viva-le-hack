# Agents

Learn how to build agents with the OpenAI API.

Copy page

Agents represent **systems that intelligently accomplish tasks**, ranging from executing simple workflows to pursuing complex, open-ended objectives.

OpenAI provides a **rich set of composable primitives that enable you to build agents**. This guide walks through those primitives, and how they come together to form a robust agentic platform.

## Overview

Building agents involves assembling components across several domains—such as **models, tools, knowledge and memory, audio and speech, guardrails, and orchestration**—and OpenAI provides composable primitives for each.

| Domain | Description | OpenAI Primitives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents#models) | Core intelligence capable of reasoning, making decisions, and processing different modalities. | [o1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1), [o3-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3-mini), [GPT-4.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4.5-preview), [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o), [GPT-4o-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini) |
| [Tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents#tools) | Interface to the world, interact with environment, function calling, built-in tools, etc. | [Function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling), [Web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search), [File search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search), [Computer use](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use) |
| [Knowledge and memory](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents#knowledge-memory) | Augment agents with external and persistent knowledge. | [Vector stores](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/retrieval#vector-stores), [File search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search), [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) |
| [Audio and speech](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents#audio-and-speech) | Create agents that can understand audio and respond back in natural language. | [Audio generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio-generation), [realtime](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime), [Audio agents](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio-agents) |
| [Guardrails](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents#guardrails) | Prevent irrelevant, harmful, or undesirable behavior. | [Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation), [Instruction hierarchy (Python)](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/), [Instruction hierarchy (TypeScript)](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/guides/guardrails/) |
| [Orchestration](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents#orchestration) | Develop, deploy, monitor, and improve agents. | [Python Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/), [TypeScript Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/), [Tracing](https://platform.openai.com/traces), [Evaluations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals), [Fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) |
| [Voice agents](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/voice-agents) | Create agents that can understand audio and respond back in natural language. | [Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime), [Voice support in the Python Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/voice/quickstart/), [Voice support in the TypeScript Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/) |

## Models

| Model | Agentic Strengths |
| --- | --- |
| [o3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3) and [o4-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o4-mini) | Best for long-term planning, hard tasks, and reasoning. |
| [GPT-4.1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4.1) | Best for agentic execution. |
| [GPT-4.1-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4.1-mini) | Good balance of agentic capability and latency. |
| [GPT-4.1-nano](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4.1-nano) | Best for low-latency. |

Large language models (LLMs) are at the core of many agentic systems, responsible for making decisions and interacting with the world. OpenAI’s models support a wide range of capabilities:

- **High intelligence:** Capable of [reasoning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning) and planning to tackle the most difficult tasks.
- **Tools:** [Call your functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) and leverage OpenAI's [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools).
- **Multimodality:** Natively understand text, images, audio, code, and documents.
- **Low-latency:** Support for [real-time audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) conversations and smaller, faster models.

## Tools

Tools enable agents to interact with the world. OpenAI supports [**function calling**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) to connect with your code, and [**built-in tools**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools) for common tasks like web searches and data retrieval.

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) | Interact with developer-defined code. |
| [Web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search) | Fetch up-to-date information from the web. |
| [File search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) | Perform semantic search across your documents. |
| [Computer use](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use) | Understand and control a computer or browser. |
| [Local shell](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-local-shell) | Execute commands on a local machine. |

## Knowledge and memory

Knowledge and memory help agents store, retrieve, and utilize information beyond their initial training data. **Vector stores** enable agents to search your documents semantically and retrieve relevant information at runtime. Meanwhile, **embeddings** represent data efficiently for quick retrieval, powering dynamic knowledge solutions and long-term agent memory. You can integrate your data using OpenAI’s [vector stores](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/retrieval#vector-stores) and [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

## Guardrails

Guardrails ensure your agents behave safely, consistently, and within your intended boundaries—critical for production deployments. Use OpenAI’s free [Moderation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation) to automatically filter unsafe content. Further control your agent’s behavior by leveraging the [instruction hierarchy](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/), which prioritizes developer-defined prompts and mitigates unwanted agent behaviors.

## Orchestration

Building agents is a process. OpenAI provides tools to effectively build, deploy, monitor, evaluate, and improve agentic systems.
